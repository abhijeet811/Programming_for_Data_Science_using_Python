# Udacity-Programming-for-Data-Science-using-Python-Nanodegree
This is a certified Nanodegree course on - Data Science programming at Udacity learning platform. More details on the Nanodegree and the project can be accessed using this Link on [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).

### The Aim of the course:
To Learn the programming fundamentals required for a career in data science using Python language. Study the relational databases and interact with them using Postgre SQL language. And use GIT version control tool to publish the work online. By the end of the program, was able to use Python, SQL, Command Line, and Git.	

### Course Curriculam:
Introduction to SQL Learned SQL fundamentals such as JOINs, Aggregations, Subqueries and advanced Window functions. Learned how to use SQL to answer complex business problems.
#### Project 1:[Investigate a Sakila Database](https://github.com/abhijeet811/Programming_for_Data_Science_using_Python/tree/master/Project%20-1): 
In this project, investigated a relational database while working with PostgreSQL. Completed the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer the questions, and finished by sharing the findings.
