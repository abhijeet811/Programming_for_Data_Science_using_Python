### Project Title
EXPLORE US BIKESHARE DATA ANALYSIS	

### Description
The developed CLI program allows the user to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. The user is also able to chose to view raw data and to sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.

This program is structured in two steps: 
In a first moment, the user selects the filters that are going to be applied to the database. The user is able to chose as many filters as it would like. After this step, the DataFrame for the analysis is created based on the filters chosen by the user.

In a second moment, the user is able to chose, from a list of options, the statistics the user would like to calculate, based on the available filtered data.As of April 2, 2019 the user is now able to chose to view raw data and also able sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.
